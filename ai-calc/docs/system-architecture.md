# System Architecture Document

## Overview
This document describes the high-level architecture of the Calculator Web Application. The system is designed as a web-based calculator service that provides basic mathematical operations through RESTful API endpoints.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Web Server Layer
- Handles incoming HTTP POST requests
- Routes requests to appropriate mathematical operation handlers
- Processes request parameters
- Returns JSON responses

### 2. Operation Layer
- Implements core mathematical operations
- Validates input parameters
- Performs calculations
- Formats results according to specifications

### 3. Response Handler
- Formats operation results into JSON
- Applies proper naming conventions for different operations
- Handles error cases

## System Flow
1. Client sends POST request to specific operation endpoint
2. Web server validates request and extracts parameters
3. Operation layer performs calculation
4. Response handler formats result
5. JSON response returned to client

## Error Handling
- Division by zero returns "undefined"
- Invalid inputs will return appropriate error messages
- All errors will be returned in JSON format

## Security Considerations
- Input validation for all parameters
- Protection against overflow/underflow
- Rate limiting considerations for API endpoints
