### description
A simple web application that implements the four primary mathematical operations of addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division.

This codebase was generated from the `ai-calc/docs/requirements.md` file. 

The following steps were taken to generate this codebase:
1. Prompt the AI to generate design documents from the `requirements.md` file. These were placed in the `ai-calc/docs/` folder by the AI.
2. Prompt the AI to generate the codebase based on the `reuqirements.md` file and the generated design documentation including deployment files for testing and running the code in the development and production environments.
3. Prompt the AI for the rationale on the maximum integer limit used when validating the inputs. This was raised from `1e6` to `1e15` based on the decisions commented in the code by the AI.
